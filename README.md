# CalCOFI-hackathon

Brief overview of the visualizations I created for the hackathon:

I worked with the 1996-2012 excel dataset Charlene cleaned up because Bryant was still working on combining the 1996-2012 and 2012-2016 datasets.

After looking at all the variables together, I decided to create a line graph showing the species abundance over time for each of the 7 species categories (Centric Diatoms, Pennate Diatoms, Thecate Dinoflagellates, Athecate Dinoflagellates, Coccolithophorids, Silicoflagellates, and Misc. Taxa). It took me a while to lightly reformat the dataset to have the years in order (earliest to latest), but after I did, graphing it was pretty simple. I also labeled the x and y axis and added a title to make it more visually understandable to the audience.

After the initial graph with all the species, I also wanted to create 7 individual ones, analyzing each individual species abundance for each location (Northeast, Southeast, Alley, and Offshore). I first generated a plot for each location, then overlaid all 4 into a single graph. Because Iâ€™ve never worked with multiple graphs all at once before, setting the legend took me some time to figure out. After generating a plot for the first species, I then finished by repeating the same process for the other 6 categories.
